# [MIDI Recorder][app]

The simplest way to record MIDI.

- Records right away, no install or setup required. Automatically connects to new MIDI devices.
- Visualizes notes, pitch bends, and instrument changes, as you play, so you know its recording.
- Records **while you play**, so if you close the tab by accident, or refresh the page, or your browser crashes, or there's a power outage, you can recover the recording.

If you've got a MIDI keyboard, plug in and [try it out][app].

Built with [SimpleMidiInput.js](https://github.com/kchapelier/SimpleMidiInput.js) and [MidiFile.js](https://github.com/nfroidure/midifile)

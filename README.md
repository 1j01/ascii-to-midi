# [MIDI Recorder][app]

The simplest way to record MIDI.

Also a nice simple live MIDI visualizer.

If you've got a MIDI keyboard, plug in and [try it out][app].

Built with [SimpleMidiInput.js](https://github.com/kchapelier/SimpleMidiInput.js) and [MidiFile.js](https://github.com/nfroidure/midifile)

### TODO

* Show note velocity

* Record and show aftertouch pressure

* Maybe allow scrolling back (pausing automatically (not recording, just the view))

* Color notes by channel or instrument (doesn't matter much with a single keyboard)

* View options: horizontal mode, zooming, maybe themes

* Offline support with a service worker

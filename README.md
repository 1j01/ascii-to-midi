# [MidiCowDont][app] (ridiculous working title)

An extremely simple online live MIDI visualizer,
built with [SimpleMidiInput.js](https://github.com/kchapelier/SimpleMidiInput.js) and [MidiFile.js](TODO)

If you've got a MIDI keyboard, plug in and [try it out][app].

I intend to make this into a MIDI *recorder*...

### TODO

* Show note velocity and aftertouch pressure

* Record MIDI (automatically, by default)

* Rename project, maybe to "midi-recorder"?

* Maybe allow scrolling back (pausing automatically (not recording, just the view))

* Color notes by channel or instrument (doesn't matter much with a single keyboard)

* View options: horizontal mode, zooming, maybe themes

* Offline support (w/ a service worker)

* Relicense

* midi recorder online html5

# [MidiCowDont][app] (ridiculous working title)

An extremely simple online live MIDI visualizer,
built with [SimpleMidiInput.js](https://github.com/kchapelier/SimpleMidiInput.js)

If you've got a MIDI keyboard, plug in and [try it out][app].

I intend to make this into a MIDI *recorder*.

### TODO

* Show pitch bends (should be fun)

* Record MIDI (automatically, by default)

* Rename project (even MidiCalzone would be better, but specifically...) to midi-recorder (probably?)

* Maybe allow scrolling back (pausing automatically)

* Color notes by channel or instrument (doesn't matter much with a single keyboard)

* View options: horizontal mode, zooming, maybe themes
